This is a version of the s3c2440camera linux driver that is being ported to the mini2440.

It is not working. 
It compiles! (i fixed all of the compile errors on the 3.1.x kernel) - but does not detect the camera connected. 
I think its some issue with the timing registers - and i got started to fix it...

and in the meantime, i got distracted with stuff like how to pay for food and stuff..

so i'l get back to this later, when i have time to indulge my hobby.
you can always help if you want.
